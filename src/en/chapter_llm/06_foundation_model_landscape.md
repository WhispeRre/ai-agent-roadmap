# Foundation Model Landscape and Selection Guide

> 🌍 *"Models iterate rapidly — today's SOTA may be tomorrow's baseline. But understanding the evolution trends lets you make better choices amid change."*

In the previous sections, we learned about the basic principles of LLMs, prompt engineering, API calls, and model parameters. That knowledge represents the "unchanging" underlying capabilities. This section discusses the "changing" part — **the technical frontier and industry landscape of foundation models**.

As an Agent developer, you don't need to train your own foundation model, but you must understand the capability boundaries and development trends of models — because **the choice of model directly determines the ceiling of your Agent**.

![Foundation Model Landscape and Four Major Trends](../svg/chapter_llm_06_landscape.svg)

## 2024–2026: Four Major Trends in Foundation Models

### Trend 1: The Leap in Reasoning Capability

In September 2024, OpenAI's o1 first proved the feasibility of "trading more reasoning time for better results." In January 2025, the open-source release of DeepSeek-R1 ignited the democratization of reasoning models — it was the first to demonstrate how pure RL training (GRPO) could cause Chain-of-Thought capability to emerge spontaneously in a model.

In April 2025, OpenAI released o3 and o4-mini, achieving **multimodal reasoning** ("thinking while looking at images") and autonomous tool chain calls for the first time. In August 2025, **GPT-5** was officially released, with reasoning capability built in as a native feature, eliminating the need for a separate o-series model.

By early 2026, reasoning had become standard in all mainstream models:

| Model | Release | Reasoning Mode | Key Breakthrough |
|-------|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Claude Opus 4.7** | 2026.04 | Adaptive thinking depth | SWE-bench Verified #1, visual capability tops charts, new tokenizer |
| **GPT-5.4** | 2026.03 | Built-in Thinking mode | Reasoning+coding+Computer Use+search unified, 1M context |
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | 2026.02 | Adaptive thinking depth | 1M context (Beta) + SWE-bench 80.8% |
| **GPT-5** | 2025.08 | Built-in intelligent routing | SWE-bench 75%, unified system architecture, multimodal |
| **Claude Opus 4** | 2025.05 | Deep reasoning | SWE-bench 72.5%, continuous 7-hour operation |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 2025.03 | Native multimodal reasoning | 1M context + dynamic reasoning budget control |
| **DeepSeek-R1** | 2025.01 | Pure RL reasoning | Open-source reasoning model ignites the world, GRPO training |
| **Kimi K2.6** | 2026.04 | Agent reasoning | 1T params open-source, 13-hour coding, 300 sub-agents parallel |
| **Kimi K2** | 2025.07 | Agent reasoning | 1T total/32B active, MuonClip optimizer, open-source Agent SOTA |
| **Qwen3-235B-A22B** | 2025.04 | Hybrid reasoning (fast/slow) | Open-source flagship, surpasses DeepSeek-R1 and o1 |

> 💡 **Impact on Agents**: Reasoning models give Agents a qualitative leap in "planning" and "complex decision-making." In real engineering, more and more Agents adopt a "fast-slow dual system" — fast models for simple routing, reasoning models for complex planning. The arrival of GPT-5 and Claude 4.6 makes this switching more seamless — reasoning capability is now built into general-purpose models.

### Trend 2: MoE and the Efficiency Revolution

Large models keep getting larger, but **inference costs are falling** — driven by the comprehensive victory of **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**.

The core idea of MoE: the total parameter count can be very large (hundreds of billions), but only a small fraction is activated during each inference. Like a large company with hundreds of employees, but only the most suitable dozen are assigned to each project.

```python
# Intuitive understanding of MoE models (conceptual illustration)
class MixtureOfExperts:
    """
    Using Qwen3.5-Plus as an example:
    Total parameters: 397B
    Active per inference: 17B (~4.3% only)
    Effect: Approaches or exceeds trillion-parameter dense models, at a fraction of the inference cost
    """
    def __init__(self, num_experts=128, active_experts=8):
        self.num_experts = num_experts
        self.active_experts = active_experts
    
    def forward(self, input_tokens):
        # Router decides which experts to activate
        scores = self.router(input_tokens)
        top_k = scores.topk(self.active_experts)
        # Only selected experts participate in computation
        return sum(expert(input_tokens) * w for expert, w in top_k)
```

| Model | Total Params | Active Params | Architecture Highlights |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Kimi K2.6** | 1T | 32B | K2 upgrade, 13-hour coding, 300 sub-agents parallel, SWE-bench Pro 58.6% |
| **Kimi K2** | 1T | 32B | MuonClip optimizer, trillion-parameter open-source MoE |
| **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B** | 35B | 3B | Released 2026.04, lightweight MoE, extreme efficiency |
| **Llama 4 Maverick** | ~400B | 17B | 128 experts, native multimodal, text generation surpasses GPT-4.1 |
| **Qwen3-235B-A22B** | 235B | 22B | Hybrid reasoning, Apache 2.0, tops open-source leaderboard |
| **Qwen3-30B-A3B** | 30B | 3B | Lightweight MoE, runs on single GPU |
| **DeepSeek-V3** | 671B | 37B | MoE architecture, $5.57M training cost, best price-performance |
| **DeepSeek-V3-0324** | 685B | 37B | Minor update, major coding improvement |
| **Gemma 4-26B** | 26B | 4B (active) | Apache 2.0, native video/image, 256K context |
| **Llama 4 Scout** | 109B | 17B | 16 experts, 10M token ultra-long context |

> 💡 **Impact on Agents**: MoE makes "large model capability + small model cost" a reality. The biggest change in early 2026 is **Kimi K2.6 open-sourcing at trillion-parameter scale** with 300 sub-agents running in parallel, pushing MoE-based Agent capability to new heights. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B achieves extreme efficiency with only 3B active parameters. DeepSeek-V3-0324 significantly enhances coding and tool-calling capability. These advances mean Agent operating costs are falling rapidly.

### Trend 3: The Full Rise of the Open-Source Ecosystem

In 2025–2026, open-source models are no longer just "catching up" with closed-source — they have **formed a competitive balance** and even **locally surpassed** closed-source in multiple areas:

- **Llama 4 Scout**: 10M token ultra-long context, suitable for Agent tasks requiring very long documents

This means Agent developers no longer need to "force a fit" — the models themselves are designed for Agents.

## Multimodal Foundation Models: More Than Just Text

In 2026, foundation models are almost all **natively multimodal** — supporting mixed input and output of text, images, audio, and video at the architecture level.

```python
# Typical multimodal Agent call
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-5",  # GPT-5 natively supports multimodal
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What's wrong with this architecture diagram? Please provide improvement suggestions."},
            {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "data:image/png;base64,..."}}
        ]
    }]
)

# GPT-5 can not only "understand" images, but also generate images and have real-time voice conversations
```

**Mainstream Multimodal Model Comparison**:

| Model | Release | Input Modalities | Output Modalities | Special Capabilities |
|-------|---------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Claude Opus 4.7** | 2026.04 | Text+Image+PDF | Text | SWE-bench Verified #1, image input 3.75M pixels, visual capability tops charts |
| **GPT-5.4** | 2026.03 | Text+Image+Audio | Text+Image | Computer Use surpasses humans, reasoning+coding+search unified, 1M context |
| **GPT-5** | 2025.08 | Text+Image+Audio | Text+Image+Audio | Real-time voice conversation, native image generation, Computer Use |
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | 2026.02 | Text+Image+PDF | Text | 1M context (Beta), enterprise-grade Agent workflows |
| **Gemini 2.5 Pro** | 2025.03 | Text+Image+Video+Audio | Text+Image | Native video understanding, 1M context |
| **Kimi K2.6** | 2026.04 | Text | Text | Trillion-param open-source, 300 sub-agents parallel, Agent coding SOTA |
| **Kimi K2** | 2025.07 | Text | Text | Trillion-param Agent SOTA, strongest tool calling |
| **Llama 4 Maverick** | 2025.04 | Text+Image | Text | Open-source multimodal MoE, ~400B total params |
| **Phi-4-multimodal** | 2025.02 | Text+Image+Speech | Text | Only 5.6B params, unified multimodal architecture |

## The Rise of Small Models: SLM and Edge Deployment

The progress of **Small Language Models (SLMs)** is remarkable — 14B parameter models from 2025 have comprehensively surpassed GPT-4 from 2023.

```python
# Impressive small model performance (2025–2026 benchmark data)
slm_benchmarks = {
    "Phi-4 (14B)":             {"MMLU": 84.8, "HumanEval": 82.6, "GSM8K": 94.5},
    "Phi-4-reasoning (14B)":   {"MMLU": 86.2, "HumanEval": 85.1, "GSM8K": 95.8},
    "Qwen 3 (8B)":            {"MMLU": 81.2, "HumanEval": 79.8, "GSM8K": 91.3},
    "Llama 4 Scout (17B act)": {"MMLU": 83.5, "HumanEval": 80.1, "GSM8K": 92.1},
    "Phi-4-mini (3.8B)":      {"MMLU": 72.1, "HumanEval": 68.5, "GSM8K": 84.2},
    # Comparison: GPT-4 from 2023 (~1.7T params estimated)
    "GPT-4 (2023)":           {"MMLU": 86.4, "HumanEval": 67.0, "GSM8K": 92.0},
}

# Phi-4-reasoning (14B) has comprehensively surpassed GPT-4 (2023) in coding and math!
# Phi-4-mini (3.8B) can even run on a phone and still do function calling
# This means: Agents don't necessarily need the largest model
```

> 💡 **Impact on Agents**: SLMs allow Agents to run locally on **phones, laptops, and edge devices**, enabling zero-latency, fully private interactions. Apple Intelligence, Google's Gemini Nano, and Microsoft's Phi-4-mini are all products of this trend. Phi-4-multimodal handles speech, vision, and text simultaneously with just 5.6B parameters, opening the door for edge-side multimodal Agents.

## Model Selection Guide for Agent Developers

With so many model choices, how do you pick the right foundation model for your Agent?

```python
def select_model(requirements: dict) -> str:
    """Agent model selection decision function (April 2026 edition)"""
    
    budget = requirements.get("monthly_budget_usd", 100)
    task_type = requirements.get("task_type", "general")
    privacy = requirements.get("privacy_required", False)
    latency_ms = requirements.get("max_latency_ms", 5000)
    reasoning = requirements.get("complex_reasoning", False)
    agent_native = requirements.get("agent_native", False)
    
    # Decision tree
    if privacy:
        if reasoning:
            return "Kimi K2.6 (self-hosted)"  # Open-source + Agent + best price-performance
        elif latency_ms < 500:
            return "Phi-4 / Qwen3-8B (local deployment)"  # Edge SLM
        else:
            return "Qwen3-235B / Llama 4 Maverick (self-hosted)"  # Open-source general
    
    if agent_native:
        if budget > 500:
            return "Claude Opus 4.7 / GPT-5.4"  # Top-tier Agent experience
        else:
            return "Kimi K2.6 API / DeepSeek-V3 API"  # Value Agent (K2.6 is 1/8 the price of Opus 4.6)
    
    if reasoning:
        if budget > 500:
            return "Claude Opus 4.7 / GPT-5.4"  # Top-tier reasoning
        else:
            return "DeepSeek-V3 API / o4-mini"  # Value reasoning
    
    if budget < 50:
        return "DeepSeek-V3 API / GPT-4o-mini"  # Extreme value
    
    return "GPT-5.4 / Claude Sonnet 4.6"  # Balanced general choice
```
